# Android Gradle Plugin

- [MUST READ]http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide

    As the new Android SDK build system is working in progress, some items in this article may be a bit of out-of-date, you can also refer to the official doc, [Configuring Gradle](https://developer.android.com/tools/building/configuring-gradle.html) and [Android Plugin for Gradle](https://developer.android.com/tools/building/plugin-for-gradle.html), almost same thing.

- http://blog.danlew.net/2015/04/27/victor/, after reading this article, you should basically know how to write a plugin for gradle.

## Run Gradle in terminal

Gradle is installed when installing Android Studio by default, the gradle executable is usually installed at `<user_home>/.gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-<version>-bin/<some_key>/gradle-<version>/bin/`, you have to add this path to `.bashrc`, for instance:

```bash
# gradle
export GRADLE=/root/.gradle/wrapper/dists/gradle-2.5-all/d3xh0kipe7wr2bvnx5sk0hao8/gradle-2.5/bin/
export PATH=$PATH:$GRADLE
```

then, you can run `gradle` in terminal directly.
